  review1: Our stay at Casa Nautilus exceeded all expectations! We were pleasantly surprised by the interior room's tranquility and spaciousness despite the absence of an outside window. It was impeccably clean and equipped with all necessary amenities, including air conditioning, TV, and a hairdryer. The complimentary welcome beer was a thoughtful touch, and mornings on the rooftop terrace with coffee were serene.

  review2: Casa Nautilus offers excellent accommodation right in the heart of Cadiz. The rooms are clean, cozy, and come with all the essentials for a comfortable stay. We particularly enjoyed the nautical theme throughout the hotel, adding to its charm. The location couldn't be better, just steps away from the cathedral and within a convenient 10-minute walk from the train station.

Our interior room, though lacking an outside window, provided a quiet retreat and was equipped with all the necessary amenities. The rooftop terrace, with its captivating views, was a highlight of our mornings. The hotel's attention to detail and affordable rates truly set it apart.
